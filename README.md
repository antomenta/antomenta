- 👋 Hi, I’m @antomenta
- 👀 I’m interested in challenging myself every day to learn something new and continue growing as a programmer. Also, movies and chocolate.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web development with The Odin Project.
- 💞️ I am a newbie so I don't even know what I’m looking to collaborate on yet, but I am a big believer in helping others and asking for help.
- 📫 How to reach me - I'm still trying to figure this one out!
